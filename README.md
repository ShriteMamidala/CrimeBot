Project Name: CrimeBot
Discription: CrimeBOT is a surveillance tool designed to identify porch pirates by analyzing webcam footage in real-time. It first detects faces using YOLO, assigns IDs based on similarity to track multiple people if needed, and processes the faces through two separate Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) machine learning models: one for demographic information and another for a set of 28 other attributes. These CNNâ€™s output feature vectors, which are then processed by an LLM to generate a detailed, objective description of the individual. The goal is to provide law enforcement with a quick and accurate way to identify suspects, aiding in the fight against package theft.
